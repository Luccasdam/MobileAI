At the momment there's no Gameplay Ability System neither GameplayTags. Since there's nothing complex for now, it could even be using Finite State Machine to handle the AI Behavior, instead of using Behavior Tree.

Since the purpose is to make more complex AI the AI Behavior Tree is implemented and in the future I will include the use of GAS and GameplayTags.
